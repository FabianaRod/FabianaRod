# Welcome to my Data Analytics Project Repository 📊

Hi, I'm **Fabiana**, an Industrial Engineering professional skilled in **data analysis** and a strong commercial management background. 
I am now embarking on an exciting transition into the world of data, so I decided to create this repository of projects that shows my strengths 🦾.

I should also mention that I speak **Spanish** (native), **English** and **French**. 🌎

## Professional Experience 🚀

With almost 6 years of experience, I have cultivated analytical and problem solving skills throughout my career. For the past years, I have worked in the B2B and B2C commercial area, managing corporate accounts and clients. This experience has provided me with a unique understanding of customer needs and the importance of making **data-driven decisions**.

## Technical Skills 🛠️

- **Languages:** Python for Analytics, T-SQL
- **Analysis and Visualization Tools:** Excel, Tableau, SQL Server, PowerBI
- **Development Environments:** Visual Studio

## Featured Projects 🌟

- **ETL Project using Visual Studio:** Took me a while but ended up solving connections, creating variables and containers, converting data, managing lookups and derived columns, also aggregations and sortings, among others (https://bit.ly/SSISProjectFabiana).
- **Contoso Sales DAX Project:** Applied almost 60 different calculations using DAX (https://bit.ly/ProyectoContosoSalesDAXFabianaRodriguez).

## Future Goals 🎯

Apply my analytical skills to break into data and get a job. I am excited to contribute to this field, and this repository is a reflection of my journey towards that goal.
I'm currently being part of the G6 **ONE - Oracle Next Education** so this is another short-term goal for me.
